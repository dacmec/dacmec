# Hi there, My name is Daniel ğŸ‘‹


## I'm a young and creative, Developer


I'm a Full-Stack Web developer based in BogotÃ¡,
ColÃ³mbia. I'm passionate about learning and technology. During the past 4
months, I've been acquiring experience as a web developer by taking part in
a Bootcamp with over 700 hours of coding. This left me hungry for more, so,
I'm looking for my first job in tech, somewhere I can expand my knowledge,
learn new abilities and improve on those I already have. Nevertheless, I'm a
fast learner and I will adapt with ease to new technologies.
